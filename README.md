- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmikushin
- 👀 I’m interested in GPU computing, eyetracking research, electronics, compiler technology, financial markets software and numerical simulations of many kinds
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI agents
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hard challenges that can make the world better
- :man_scientist: I'm an [ENTP](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality) personality and I turn everything I touch into a manifest to humanity
- 📫 How to reach me: [mikush.in](https://mikush.in)

You can always find me where research and industrial programming (C/C++ Fortran, Python) and classical supercomputing (MPI, OpenMP) meets modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs, embedded ASICs) and performance optimization (algorithms, profiling, vectorization, etc.). I co-founded Purple Gaze Inc. to show how inexpensive and fast eyetracking systems can be. I enjoy occasional consulting in CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC and Machine Learning. I earned my PhD from the University of Lausanne by programming supercomputing software for economics and finance.

I bring expertise in GPU-accelerated development to organizations facing challenging computational problems. My skills can help teams to port existing algorithms to leverage NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPUs (including very old legacy source code), implement specialized algorithms for compute-memory balance, and create portable solutions that work across platforms.

As an active daily user of LLMs for code development, I leverage these AI tools to enhance productivity and problem-solving.
